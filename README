Orgchart3: A pure HTML5 Orgchart Tree editor.

See a running example at http://ayotli.com/orgchart3

Final version might not work on current browsers since saveAs is not yet implemented; might work flawless in short.

Meanwhile, you can replace function saveChart() with a server-side writer and downloader, or use an alternative code like Eli Grey's FileSaver.js: http://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js
